#Autonomous Faucet Project

#Overview

The Autonomous Faucet project utilizes ROBOTC programming to automate the handwashing and soap dispensing process using ultrasonic sensors and motors, enabling touchless, hygienic operation.


#Software Implementation

The software, fully developed in ROBOTC, prioritizes accurate sensor data processing and motor control to create a seamless, touch-free experience. The codebase follows a modular structure:

  faucet.c: Manages automatic water flow activation based on ultrasonic sensor input.

  soapDispenser.c: Automates the soap dispensing mechanism, triggered by hand detection.

  temperature.c: Module for water temperature control.

  display.c: Handles user interactions and system status updates.

  main.c: Integrates and coordinates all software modules for cohesive operation.
